I don’t just code — I *engineer clarity from chaos*.
My craft is transforming complex systems into elegant, scalable realities.
I live in the intersection between **art, logic, and rebellion**, where clean architecture meets restless curiosity.

## 🎯 **Solution Philosophy**

1. **🚀 Prototype first, polish later** — speed reveals truth.
2. **⚙️ Force meets finesse** — make it work, then make it sing.
3. **🧱 Build like it’ll outlive you** — scale is a consequence of integrity.
4. **💡 Learn until mastery** — ignorance is only a temporary state.

## 🛠️ **The Everyday Arsenal**

⚡ Next.js · 📘 TypeScript · 🗄 Prisma · 🐘 PostgreSQL
🎨 Tailwind · 🐳 Docker · 🤖 ChatGPT · 🧠 Claude · ✏️ Cursor

> Clean architecture, typed precision, and a touch of chaos — that’s my flow.

## 🌄 **Beyond Code**

Born in Concepción, raised between cables and cassette tapes.
I’ve hacked, built, and dreamed my way through the web — now I write software that **balances ethics and efficiency**, for startups, AI platforms, and people who dare to think different.
