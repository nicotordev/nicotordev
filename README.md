# 🧩 NicoTorDev — Full‑Stack Problem Solver

> **Next.js Specialist · AI‑Native Builder · Turning Complexity into Clarity**

My superpower is **untangling complex problems** and transforming them into simple, scalable flows. I enjoy my comfort zone—it's built on solid practices—but I **push its edges whenever a new challenge calls**.

## 🎯 Solution Philosophy

1. **🔍 Rapid prototyping** → Build fast, iterate faster.
2. **⚡ Brute force first** → Throw everything at it, then optimize.
3. **⚡ Scale by force** → Make it work now, fix it later if needed.
4. **📈 Sustainable growth** → Build foundations that last.
